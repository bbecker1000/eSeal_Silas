Next steps for eSeal Data Analysis

1. Plot Data through time for each age class and for each site.  ALSO plot total for all sites.
2. For COWS, use the largest count of the year and correct for count (date adjusted) using the data in appendix of Condit et al 2021.
3. For all other age classes, just use largest count of year.

1. EPUP should be grouped with PUP.  
2. please make the plots as we discussed, but we will likely only do statistical analysis on:
  - COWS
  - PUPS combined with WEANERS on the same day for a maximum annual count.
3. Note that YEAR is tricky since the surveys often start in december of the previous year and continue through the winter of the current year.  
4. So surveys from December should be included with JAN, FEB, MARCH, APRIL, etc. of the current year.

Silas has coded plotting functions.
Next steps:

1. Think about population trend analyses for the tree sites and population as whole.
  A. FIRST BASIC
    i. Simple linear regression on log(counts) for cows and pups/weaners at the three sites and as a whole. 
    ii. Could also do generalized linear model with counts as poisson distributed.
  B. THEN ADVANCED
    i. Use either the ATSAR package or the MARSS package to build multivariate state-space models of the three sites to get population trajectories
    ii. ATSAR: https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa-labs/
